# Overview

This app is about personal budget management, where users, income, expenses, and categories are recorded. I created this app to demonstrate how Python works with the Firebase cloud database.

The application has the following features:
* Database created on Firebase.
* Connecting to Firebase database from Python.
* Creating API in Python using Flask.
* API can read, insert, update and delete data on Firebase.
* Data validation in the API to avoid recording incomplete or incorrect data.
